**Project Vision**

_**Problem Statement**_
The exceeding pace of growth of the human species, the basic need of earning money for survival increases. The existing freelance and all other mainstream online job marketplaces have taken a turn for worse for both clients and freelancers. These giant conglomerates tend to adopt profit-centric policy-making which adversely affects smooth and reliable experience mainly for freelancers and job seekers. Some problems include difficulty in receiving payments, extremely high fees, biased feedback, and unexpected suspension of accounts, amongst others.

_**Motivation**_
We believe that the current freelance infrastructure is sort of an outdated version. How exactly? Well we all know that the existing Web is under transformation from Web2 to Web3. Web2, as we all know, is the version of the internet that is dominated by large business organizations and conglomerates which provide services in exchange for either money or your personal data. Web3, on the other hand, refers to the decentralized ecosystem of applications that run on blockchain. We believe that it is a new patron model for the internet.
We plan on creating a decentralized freelance platform/marketplace that addresses the problems faced by both clients and freelancers in an effective and efficient manner.

_**Business Opportunity**_
The business opportunity at hand is believed to be extravagant. Seeing the demographics of South-Asian region and its crazy demand in the remote work industry worldwide, along with the absence of any big mainstream platform of decentralized nature operating in this industry, we see an optimal gap that can be filled using the right approach at the right time.

_**Objectives**_
We, as DeLance, wish to provide a complete end-to-end platform product that is ready to deploy. A couple of our objectives include:
To build an application that allows companies to outsource their work to remotely located freelancers
To reduce payable fees both at the ends of client and freelancer respectively
To remove/reduce the implication of centralized freelance platforms/third-parties and eliminate censorship
No such platform exists, especially in the South Asian region. Given this region is known for its cheap skilled workforce, such a platform is assumed to be a need of the hour
To make the freelance economy accessible to anyone and everyone irrespective of their race, gender, ethnicity, color, religion etc
To eventually develop a successful prototype that could easily be converted into a business

_**Project Scope**_
As far as the scope of our project is concerned, we aim to create a complete end-to-end web application product. We shall be targeting the South Asian region because these markets are renowned for their cheap skilled workforce that the West often wishes to utilize. The language of communication, within our platform, will only be English and shall only expand beyond the scope of this project. This is because English is a global language that most humans happen to be acquainted with. For the blockchain part, we shall be setting up our own local blockchain using Ethereumâ€™s geth.
